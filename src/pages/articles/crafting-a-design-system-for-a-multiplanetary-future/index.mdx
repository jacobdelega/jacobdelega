import { ArticleLayout } from '@/components/ArticleLayout'
import Image from 'next/future/image'

export const meta = {
  author: 'Jacob Delega',
  date: '2023-11-12',
  title: 'Very first blog',
  description:
    'Today we accomplished the knowledge to successfully publish to a personal blog with Next / TailWindCSS.',
}

export default (props) => <ArticleLayout meta={meta} {...props} />

As I progress with learning NextJS, React, TailWindCSS, and web development as a whole. I will aim to actively keep up to date with my personal blog to look back at. 


Below is a very basic testing of a code snippet to see how the articles function...

```c
<div className="md:border-l md:border-zinc-100 md:pl-6 md:dark:border-zinc-700/40">
        <div className="flex max-w-3xl flex-col space-y-16">
                {articles.map((article) => (
                <Article key={article.slug} article={article} />
        ))}
        </div>
</div>
```

Currently I am still very new to web development especially with NextJS, and TailWindCSS. Although I must say I love the new frameworks especially TailWindCSS's libraries as they make development of modern looking websites super easy!
