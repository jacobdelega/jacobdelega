**The beginning stages**

The New Venture Exposition had been on my partner and I radar for a few months now. We were eager to test our business idea against expert feedback and the spark of fellow entrepreneurs. Brainstorming sessions became a regular fixture, filled with whiteboard scribbles, heated discussions, and a growing sense of conviction.

Weeks of brainstorming allowed us to create the final iteration of our business idea. We made sure that our pitch was perfect, ensuring it was clear, concise, and communicated the value proposition effectively. At first it was far from perfect, but countless rehearsals honed it into a sharp presentation.

**Table Setup**

<div className="flex">
  We aimed to create a visually appealing and informative posters that would
  draw visitors in and spark conversations. I also created a landing page that
  also broke down more of our buisness idea allowing those to still read up on
  our product even after speaking with us.

**Judge Interactions**

The opportunity to connect with such a brilliant and accomplished group of people was truly invaluable. Every judge who visited our table offered insightful feedback and guidance for the future of our business. The entire experience, from the insightful conversations to the vibrant energy of the event, was a fantastic learning experience and networking opportunity.

**Event Turnout**

The event turnout was fantastic, but the true highlight was winning the Social Award at the New Venture Exposition! This recognition from the judges served as a powerful validation of our idea's potential. The award ceremony ignited a renewed passion within us, and we're now even more driven to push forward with the next steps in our project. Knowing there's a lot of potential fuels our determination to turn our vision into reality.
